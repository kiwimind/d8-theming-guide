# The Drupal 8 Theming guide

Drupal 8 is going to be a huge change for the entire community. I created this theming guide to get front-end developers ready for Drupal 8. The entire documentation is written during my free time.

The goal of the theming guide is to provide you with a complete overview of the front-end changes in Drupal 8 and on getting you started with creating your own custom theme.

![With more than 200 new features and improvements, the upcoming release of the worldâ€™s leading open source web content management platform will win you over.](https://www.drupal.org/sites/all/modules/drupalorg/drupalorg/images/d8.svg)
