## About the author

Hi, my name is Sander and I'm a web developer from Belgium. At the beginning of 2014, I began an internship at a company that was mainly developing websites with Drupal. During this internship, I got really excited about Drupal. "Come for the code, stay for the community," is what I kept reading on the Drupal.org website. Later that year, at a local sprint, I had the chance to start contributing and join the community myself. It got very real when my very first patch for Drupal 8 core got committed. I came for the code and I stayed for the communityâ€¦ Later that year, I started traveling around Europe to attend various Drupal events. During those travels, I met so many new interesting and talented people. These amazing people have inspired me during the writing of this book.

## About this book

Somewhere after the summer of 2014, I decided to start writing a theming guide. At first, it was a very small markdown document. It was a (Github) gist with an overview of front-end changes in Drupal 8. Since I felt that there was so much to talk about, I decided to split up the document into chapters. Before I knew, a book was born. What you're reading right now is the result of hours of work and free time. If you enjoy reading this book, please let me know. The appreciation from several people has been my motivation to continue working on this book.
